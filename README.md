# **Enhancing Marketing ROI through Targeted RFM Segmentation: A Case Study with Olist Store**

This GitHub repository was created as part of Purwadhika's DTI Data Science Final Project. The project utilizes the [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) to address a series of business problems and challenges faced by the company. The goal is to leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques, including RFM segmentation and targeted marketing strategies, to enhance customer engagement and optimize marketing ROI. This repository contains the dataset, code, and documentation related to the projectâ€™s objectives and findings.

[Olist](https://www.olist.com) is a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace integrator that serves as an online platform for aggregating e-commerce sites, making it easier for businesses to sell directly on various Brazilian e-commerce platforms. The platform connects entrepreneurs with major online retailers, allowing shopkeepers to effortlessly advertise and sell their products across multiple marketplaces. This enables retail companies to expand their reach to international markets, enhance the shopping experience, and influence customer purchasing behavior.

Olist simplifies the process for small businesses across Brazil by providing access to various sales channels through a single contract. Merchants can list their products on the Olist Store and fulfill orders using Olist's logistics partners. After a customer makes a purchase from the Olist Store, the seller is notified to fulfill the order. Once the product is delivered, or when the estimated delivery date has passed, the customer receives a satisfaction survey via email to rate their shopping experience and provide feedback.

Currently, Olist's marketing team lacks a customer segmentation strategy, treating all customers as a single homogeneous group. This approach fails to account for the diverse needs, preferences, and behaviors of different customer segments, leading to missed opportunities for targeted marketing efforts, personalized communication, and optimized customer experiences. As a result, Olist may struggle to effectively engage with its customers, potentially impacting customer satisfaction, retention rates, and overall sales growth. Developing a robust customer segmentation strategy is crucial to unlocking the full potential of Olist's marketing efforts and driving better business outcomes.
